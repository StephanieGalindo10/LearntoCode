Creating helpful tips on how to create basic frist HTML and CSS

What terminology you will see:


The role of HTML in a website is to specify the content you will see in the web browser. 

The Main Heading Tag
The first tag we will be learning is the main heading tag. Tags are a bit like a sandwich: a tag has an opening, tags have the filling, and tags have a closing. This example below using the heading sandwich shows the h1 tag, which is a main heading:

<p> tag is used to tell the browser we want a paragraph. These work just like the main and secondary headings. You must have an opening, the filling, and then the closing. 

he title attribute is used so that when the mouse is hovered over the link this is what is seen. So we have the href attribute, which is necessary for a link because its telling us where the link is going. The title attribute displays the text when the mouse is hovered over the link:

We can add a new file by selecting File>New File, and call this new file "Newpage.html."

The tag that we use for images is called the "img" tag. 
 example:   	
 
 
 <img src="background.png"></img>
 



Notes 

You begin by typing in DOCTYPE html and this tells the browser this is our website and this is an HTML document. 


Whenever you look at a web site on the internet what's shown on the actual browser content is called the body of the page, but there's more to a page than just the body. 

 web site you visit is added in an area called the page head.
 The meta tags do not need to be self-closed, this is part of the HTML standard.

CSS is not used for content, it's used to style content, to make content look pretty. One way to include CSS on a page is by using style tag. HTML only cares about the context.

For that we need to add the attribute ID, equal sign, double quotes, and in here we enter the unique ID of that particular element. An ID is a unique identifier. It cannot contain spaces

 ID instead, but we need to type in the hash sign, and then the name of the ID, and that will allow us to select a single element by ID.

 Typography is used to change fonts.
